Learning about derivatives in Calculus I, I was really questioning why the power rule ‘worked’. Why is $\frac{d}{dx}x^3 = 3x^2$? Why do we multiply by 3?  In other words, why is $\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$  and not $x^{n-1}$?

The most intuitive derivative to find is one of the line:

$$y = mx + b$$

The derivative is obviously $m$, as that’s the slope of the line. We learned that in middle school! It makes sense, as the ‘$\frac{dy}{dx}$’ is defined as rate of change in $y$ over rate of change of $x$. For every time $x$ increases by 1, $y$ increases by m. In other words, for 

$$ y = 2x + 3$$ 

The rate of change is 2. We can see this using a chart:

| *x* | *y*  | Change in *x*     | change in *y*     |
|---|----|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 5  | (initial value) | (initial value) |
| 2 | 7  | 1               | 2               |
| 3 | 9  | 1               | 2               |
| 4 | 11 | 1               | 2               |
