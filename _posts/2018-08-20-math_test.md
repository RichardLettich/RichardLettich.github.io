Learning about derivatives in Calculus I, I was really questioning why the power rule ‘worked’. Why is $\frac{d}{dx}x^3 = 3x^2$? Why do we multiply by 3?  In other words, why is $\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}$  and not $x^{n-1}$?

To answer this question let's start off with the most easiest derivative to find: one of a straight line line -

$$y = mx + b$$

The derivative is obviously $m$, as that’s the slope of the line at all poiunts. We learned that in middle school! It makes sense, as the ‘$\frac{dy}{dx}$’ is defined as rate of change in $y$ over rate of change of $x$. For every time $x$ increases by 1, $y$ increases by m. In other words, for 

$$ y = 2x + 3$$ 

The rate of change of $y$ relative to $x$ is 2. We can see this using this chart:

| *x* | *y*  | Change in *x* from previous     | change in *y* from previous    |
|---|----|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 5  | (initial value) | (initial value) |
| 2 | 7  |              +1 |  +2 |
| 3 | 9  |               +1|  +2|
| 4 | 11 | 1            +1|  +2|


We know $y$ increases by two for every increase in $x$ by one. This is because $x$’s coefficient is 2. Increasing x from 3 to 4 brought us from having 3 x ‘2’s to having 4 x 
‘2’s. (Going back to second grade, multiplication is just how many times you add something!)

We can say derivative of a linear functions $f(x)$ is just the coefficient of $x$.

Were looking to find the derivative of a function with a power of at least 2. Lets use our previous example of $x^3$, and naively apply our ‘coefficient rule’.

$$\frac{d}{dx} x^3 = \frac{d}{dx} x \cdot x \cdot x = \frac{d}{dx} x^2 \cdot x $$
$$ = x^2$$

So our derivative would seemingly be $x^2$, as that's our coefficient of x.
